## Features

- **CLI & TUI Interfaces**: A CLI for single-task operations and an interactive TUI for bulk operations and list view.
- **Vim Keybinds**: A handful of Vim actions are built into the TUI (more will be added soon).
- **Fuzzy Search & Filtering**: Find tasks quickly with partial name matching.
- **Tab Completion**: Shell completion with fuzzy matching support built into the completion script.
- **Project/Global Sources**: Load/save from the closest `.togo` file in your project tree, with a global fallback. Force with `--source project|global`.

## Installation

### Arch Linux

`togo` is available on the [Arch User Repository (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/togo-bin)

```bash
paru -S togo-bin
```

### Pre-built Binaries (Recommended)

Download the latest pre-built binaries from the [Releases](https://github.com/prime-run/togo/releases) page.

**Linux (x86_64)**

```bash
wget https://github.com/prime-run/togo/releases/download/v1.0.5/togo_1.0.5_linux_amd64.tar.gz
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
tar -xzf togo_*.tar.gz -C ~/.local/bin/togo
```

**macOS (Apple Silicon arm64)**

```bash
wget https://github.com/prime-run/togo/releases/download/v1.0.5/togo_1.0.5_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
tar -xzf togo_*.tar.gz -C ~/.local/bin/togo
```

> [!NOTE]
> Don't forget to set the `PATH` environment variable.

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### Go CLI

```bash
go install github.com/prime-run/togo@latest
```

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/prime-run/togo.git
cd togo
make
# And follow the prompts
```

All `make` installation methods should set up shell completion out of the box.
In case your shell isn't detected, you can run `togo completion --help`.

## Usage

To add a task:

```bash
togo add "Task description"
# or without quotes, it's treated as stdin!
togo add Call the client about project scope
```

### Storage: project vs global (new)

Togo can load and save your tasks from two sources:

- "project" (default): uses the closest `.togo` file found by walking up from the current directory. If none is found, it falls back to the global file.
- "global": always uses the global file in your user config directory.

Control the source with the persistent flag on any command:

```bash
# project (default)
togo list
togo add "Write docs" -s project

# force global
togo list --source global
```

Initialize project-local storage in your repo:

```bash
togo init   # creates ./\.togo with an empty JSON list
```

In the TUI, the header shows the active source as `source: project` or `source: global`.

### Managing Your Tasks

Togo provides two primary modes of operation:

#### 1. Interactive Mode (TUI)

The TUI lets you work with your todos visually and allows for bulk actions:

```bash
togo
# or
togo list           # Active todos only
togo list --all     # All todos
togo list --archived # Archived todos only
```

#### 2. Command-Line Operations

Togo offers flexible command syntax with three usage patterns:

> All commands accept the persistent `--source|-s` flag: `project` (default) or `global`.

##### a) Direct selection by partial name

```bash
togo toggle meeting
# force using global source
togo toggle meeting --source global
```

If only one task contains "meeting," it executes immediatelyâ€”no selection needed. If multiple tasks match (e.g., "team meeting" and "client meeting"), Togo automatically opens the selection list so you can choose the one you meant.

##### b) Interactive selection list

```bash
togo toggle
# against project-local source explicitly
togo toggle -s project
```

Opens a selection list where you can choose from available tasks:

  alt="main-togo-screen-shot"
  width="738">
  
</p>

As you type, Togo searches through your tasks and filters the results.

##### c) Shell completion integration

If you've configured shell completion (see below), you can use tab-completion:

```bash
togo toggle [TAB]
```

Your shell will present available tasks. Type a few letters to filter by name:

```bash
togo toggle me[TAB]
```

The shell will show only tasks containing "me"â€”perfect for quick selection.

`--source` also supports completion to `project` and `global`.

> [!TIP]
> This really speeds up task management since fuzzy matching is supported by the completion script.
> For example, to mark the task `Auto ***snapshot*** /boot ...` as `completed`,
> just running `togo toggle snap` would toggle it. If `snap` matches more than one task,
> you'll be prompted to select from the matches.

### Available Commands

- `togo add "Task description"` - Add a new task
- `togo toggle [task]` - Toggle completion status
- `togo archive [task]` - Archive a completed task
- `togo unarchive [task]` - Restore an archived task
- `togo delete [task]` - Remove a task permanently
- `togo list [flags]` - View tasks (`--all`, `--archived`)
- `togo init` - Create an empty `.togo` file in the current directory (enable project-local storage)

Notes:

- All commands accept `--source|-s {project|global}` to control where tasks are read/written.

### Features in Depth

### Shell Completion

Enabling shell completion allows for tab-completion of commands and task names, improving efficiency.

#### Zsh

```bash
# 1. Create completion directory
mkdir -p ~/.zsh/completion
echo "fpath=(~/.zsh/completion \$fpath)" >> ~/.zshrc

# 2. Enable completions
echo "autoload -Uz compinit && compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

# 3. Apply Togo completion
togo completion zsh > ~/.zsh/completion/_togo
source ~/.zshrc
```

#### Bash

```bash
# 1. Ensure completion is sourced
echo "[ -r /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion ] && . /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# 2. Install Togo completion
togo completion bash > ~/.bash_completion
source ~/.bash_completion
```

#### Fish

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/completions
togo completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/togo.fish
```

> Storage locations:
>
> - Project: nearest `./.togo` file (JSON).
> - Global: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/togo/todos.json` (or `$HOME/.config/togo/todos.json`).
